= Things to do for software developers =

Here is a list of things we'd like to do. If you decide to contribute on some of these tasks or if you want to propose other features please contact the main developers in the [http://groups.google.com/group/knack-developers Knack Developers group].

  * Write an automated build script that compiles everything and generates the installer.
  * Update all the code to use C# 2.0 features where it makes sense (e.g. Windows Forms 2, generics)
  * Port the project files to !SharpDevelop 3.0.
  * Remove Managed DirectX dependencies and use a sound library that doesn't require manual install, that has low latancy, and that is more portable (e.g. [http://code.google.com/p/portaudiosharp/ PortAudioSharp])
  * Remove Windows dependencies (e.g. do not use Windows MIDI direcly but a portable MIDI library like !PortMidi).
